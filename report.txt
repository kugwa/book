Required Packages

    We use Redis database to store all the data structures of our order book.
    The following commands show how we install Redis (in Ubuntu 16.04):

        $ wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-4.0.2.tar.gz
        $ tar -xf redis-4.0.2.tar.gz
        $ cd redis-4.0.2/
        $ make
        $ sudo make install
        $ sudo utils/install_server.sh

Required Libraries

    Since we program in C, we need Hiredis, which is a minimalistic C client
    library for the Redis database, so that we can issue commands to the Redis
    server in our C program. After Redis is built successfully, we run the
    following commands to install Hiredis headers and shared libraries:

        $ cd redis-4.0.2/deps/hiredis/
        $ sudo make install
        $ sudo ldconfig

    Also, we need JSON-C to perform I/O in JSON format. We run the following
    commands to install JSON-C headers and shared libraries:

        $ sudo apt install autoconf automake libtool # prerequisites
        $ wget https://github.com/json-c/json-c/archive/json-c-0.13-20171207.zip
        $ unzip json-c-0.13-20171207.zip
        $ cd json-c-json-c-0.13-20171207
        $ ./configure
        $ make
        $ make check
        $ sudo make install
        $ sudo ldconfig

Compilation and Execution

    All the source code is in book.c. We already provide a simple Makefile to
    build it:

        $ make

    The executable can be run in the following two ways:

        $ ./book [COMMAND]
        $ ./book
        book> [COMMAND 1]
        book> [COMMAND 2]
        .
        .
        .

    To show the usage of all commands, run:

        $ ./book help

    To test the correctness, we also provide two sample input files, bids.txt
    and asks.txt, which contain lots of bid orders and ask orders copied from
    Bitfinex. We then run the following commands to check the result:

        $ ./book < bids.txt
        $ ./book < asks.txt
        $ ./book list | less
        $ ./book ask 7902.4 7
        $ ./book list | less
        $ ./book match
        $ ./book list | less

    For more implementation details, please see the comments in book.c.
